# Arcade-Game

This game will be based on three main topics: fantasy, conquer and unicorns. The game will be developed for the arcade machine which is located at Hogeschool Rotterdam. The game will consist out of multiple dimensions using platforms. It will be event driven and has a focus on visuals like the game Hollow Knight.

## Concept & Story

You will start as a unicorn in a 'steeg' located in Rotterdam. You will find items that will bring you to different dimensions. These dimensions consist out of good and evil spirits. You have to make choices in the game to influence the story. We hope to create a lot of different endings.

## Singleplayer or Multiplayer

We are unable to answer this yet. We want to make it for 2 players. So it is more competitive and fun.
